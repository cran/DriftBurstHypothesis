  *DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.1.1
  *Fix ambiguity in a call to sqrt() for int which caused installation failure on Solaris.
  *More robust code, passing vectors of differing length for logprices and time are now stopped.
  *The Mu and Sigma vectors returned now also start with a 0 instead of uninitiated memory.
  *Documentation changed to make it more clear that the left-sided exponential kernel is used (no foresight).
